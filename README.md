# Analyzing-Vehicle-CO-Emissions-Identifying-Key-Contributors-and-Predictive-Factors

## Project Overview
This project explores vehicle carbon emissions to identify which types, classes, or attributes of vehicles contribute most to CO₂ pollution.<br/>
Leveraging a dataset of over 6,200 vehicles with attributes like engine size, fuel consumption, fuel type, and transmission, the project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.<br/>
Visual dashboards and statistical models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressors are used to understand patterns and forecast CO₂ emissions based on vehicle characteristics.<br/>

The ultimate goal is to inform both consumers and policymakers about high-emission vehicle categories and help guide efforts toward more sustainable transportation choices.
