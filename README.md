# Analyzing-Vehicle-CO-Emissions-Identifying-Key-Contributors-and-Predictive-Factors

## Project Overview
This project explores vehicle carbon emissions to identify which types, classes, or attributes of vehicles contribute most to CO₂ pollution.<br/>
Leveraging a dataset of over 6,200 vehicles with attributes like engine size, fuel consumption, fuel type, and transmission, the project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.<br/>
Visual dashboards and statistical models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressors are used to understand patterns and forecast CO₂ emissions based on vehicle characteristics.<br/>

The ultimate goal is to inform both consumers and policymakers about high-emission vehicle categories and help guide efforts toward more sustainable transportation choices.

## Problem Statement
a) Identify which vehicle classes emit the highest average CO₂.<br/>

b) Understand how fuel type, engine size, and fuel consumption correlate with emissions.<br/>

c) Determine the role of vehicle attributes (e.g., make, transmission type) in predicting carbon output.<br/>

d) Develop predictive models to estimate CO₂ emissions using vehicle specifications.<br/>

e) Guide efforts toward environmental sustainability by highlighting less eco-friendly vehicle options.

## Project Objectives
a) To analyze the relationship between vehicle characteristics (such as engine size, fuel type, transmission, and class) and CO₂ emissions.<br/>

b) To identify which categories of vehicles (make, class, or fuel type) are the highest contributors to CO₂ emissions.<br/>

c) To clean and preprocess the dataset for optimal performance in analysis and machine learning tasks.<br/>

d) To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers in the dataset.<br/>

e) To build and evaluate multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) for predicting CO₂ emissions based on vehicle attributes.<br/>

f) To compare model performance using metrics like R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).<br/>

g) To provide actionable insights that can support environmental policy decisions and encourage the use of low-emission vehicles.
